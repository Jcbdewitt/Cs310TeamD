#Time station software (group project)

This project is a clock in and clock out software developed for software engineering. In this assigenment we were tasked with creating a database system that could read in punch data from the database.
We then use this data to create Java class types of employees to have different employee object that we can call and adjusted. 

Also in the assigenment we were tasked with calculating the amount of the time any one employee should be working and how often they actually worked.
We can then use these numbers to generate a Absenteeism for any given employee. This number is show as a precentage.

This project was a group project that utilized the scrum method to complete the different assigened features that needed to be created.
